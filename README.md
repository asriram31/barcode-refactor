# BARCODE Refactor

A lightweight internal refactor of the [BARCODE](https://github.com/softmatterdb/barcode) repository.  
Essentially no changes to core functionality or GUI â€” just a cleaner, more modular structure.

## Highlights

- Replaced nested dictionaries with type-safe dataclasses  
- Modularized logic into smaller, focused files  
- Improved structure for readability, maintainability, and extensibility
